nppilot - the never-complete autopilot
======================================

A ground based autopilot for making my RC car do interesting things at
speed.

The current version consists of a ATMEGA based I/O board, BeagleBone
Black command board, and a GPS mounted in a lunch box on a 1/10th
scale buggy.  The I/O board handles the remote control input and servo
drive and runs the safety overrides.  The command board runs the PID
controllers and waypoint plotting and, as an experiment, is written
written in Go.
